# Hello!
This is where I'll be sharing some of my coding projects throughout my journey to improve my technical skills.

## About Me
I have a BSCS from The University of Texas at San Antonio. My interests are in systems and networks, but for now I have a vested interest in USB device development. In my free time I drum and spend time with my fiance.
