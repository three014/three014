# Hello!
This is where I'll be sharing some of my coding projects throughout my journey to improve my technical skills.

## About Me
I am a senior at The University of Texas at San Antonio. I mainly use C and Rust, but I've been leaning into Rust more recently. In my free time I like to play the drumset and spend time with my family.
