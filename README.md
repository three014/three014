# Hello!
This is where I'll be sharing some of my coding projects throughout my journey to improve my technical skills.

## About Me
I'm about to start my 3rd year at The University of Texas at San Antonio. I mainly use C and Rust, but I'm currently learning JavaScript for my Software Enginnering summer course. In my free time I like to play the drumset and spend time with my family.
